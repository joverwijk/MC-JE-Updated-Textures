# MC-JE-Updated-Textures
For new renders of Minecraft

# Downloading
You may download the isometric renders, provided that if you show them publicly, give Mojang credit for making these textures and add the license [CC-BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/), as their purpose is to be shown on the Minecraft Wiki, which is licensed under these terms.

# About the files
All PNG files have been compressed once using PNGOUT. Most files are therefor less than 10 kB in size. The image size of GIFs has been reduced to 150×150px where possible. When not possible, the image size of these files is 300×300px, which is also the default size of all PNG files.

New images files will be added over the course of the next few days or weeks. I will let you know here when I'm done.

# Bugs
When you see any mistakes in the files, open a bug report in the bugtracker section of this repository. Alternatively, you may also leave me a message on the #minecraft channel of Gamepedia Slack or on [my talk page](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/User_talk:DarkShadowTNT) on the Minecraft Wiki.
